```

#### ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented:**

**A. Dependency Version Pinning (`requirements.txt`)**

```txt
# Fixed compatibility issues by pinning specific versions
rich>=13.0.0,<14.0.0
typer>=0.12.0,<1.0.0
```

**B. Project Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)**

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [

```python
try:
    with Progress(...) as progress:
        # Rich progress display with full features
        pass
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Progress display failed: {e}")
    # Graceful fallback to simple print output
    # Ensures conversion continues even if progress display fails
```

#### üîß **Technical Fixes Applied:**

- Pinned compatible versions of rich and typer libraries
