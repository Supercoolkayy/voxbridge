# VoxBridge Release Documentation & Milestone Breakdown

## Version 1.0.0 – Initial Public Release
**Status:** Completed  
**Goal:** Establish a production-ready CLI and GUI tool with PyPI support and GitHub-integrated workflows.

## Milestone 1: Core CLI and Feature Set

### Objectives Achieved
- Developed the `voxbridge` CLI with major subcommands:
  - `convert`, `batch`, `doctor`, `help`
- Built support for both Unity and Roblox pipelines
- Implemented flexible batch options including file pattern matching and recursive traversal
- Added diagnostic and validation tools for user systems
- Integrated colored terminal output using `rich`

### Deliverables
- Fully operational command-line tool
- Modular batch-processing pipeline
- System diagnostics via `voxbridge doctor`
- Python-based installable script via PyPI

### CLI Usage

Install VoxBridge via PyPI:
```bash
pip install voxbridge
```

Run the system diagnostic check:
```bash
voxbridge doctor
```

Convert a single GLTF/GLB file for Unity:
```bash
voxbridge convert input.glb --engine unity --optimize-mesh
```

Convert a file for Roblox (with GUI-friendly flags):
```bash
voxbridge convert input.glb --engine roblox --optimize-mesh
```

Batch-convert all files in a directory:
```bash
voxbridge batch ./models --engine unity --pattern "*.glb" --recursive
```

Display help and subcommand options:
```bash
voxbridge --help
```

## Milestone 2: GUI Integration

### Objectives Achieved
- Implemented GUI frontend using Python’s built-in `Tkinter`
- GUI exposes core features (conversion engine, batch processing)
- Supports users with minimal terminal knowledge
- GUI works as standalone application or via PyPI entry point

### Deliverables
- Executable script: `voxbridge-gui`
- UI includes input file selection, engine target, and output options
- Built-in feedback/status window

### GUI Usage

Launch GUI after installing via pip:
```bash
voxbridge-gui
```

Make sure `tkinter` is installed on your system:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

**Windows/macOS:**  
`tkinter` is bundled by default with standard Python installers from [python.org](https://python.org).

## Milestone 3: Build System & Automation

### Objectives Achieved
- Structured modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml`
- Developed build and release automation scripts:
  - `build_cli.sh`, `build_gui.sh`, `release.sh`
- Created GitHub Actions workflow (`publish.yml`) for trusted publisher release to PyPI
- Implemented continuous integration for packaging, linting, and release validation

### Deliverables
- PyPI-compatible package hosted at [pypi.org/project/voxbridge](https://pypi.org/project/voxbridge)
- Automated publishing triggered by GitHub release events
- Secure PyPI deployment using trusted publisher credentials

## Quality Assurance & Compliance

**Completed:**
- Code formatted with `black` and verified with `flake8`
- All critical paths covered with manual testing
- Verified entry points (`voxbridge`, `voxbridge-gui`)
- Final release tested with `pip install voxbridge` on clean environments
- Packaged and published via GitHub Actions and Trusted Publisher integration

## Deployment Targets
- Unity (standard FBX/GLTF pipelines)
- Roblox (optimized 3D asset workflows)
- Python support: >=3.9
